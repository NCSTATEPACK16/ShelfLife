## [Unreleased]

### Milestone 1 — Playable Core

#### Phase 1.0 — Foundations · **gate PASS**
- Repository scaffold, Node pinned via `.nvmrc`, docs and legal skeleton, ADRs 0001–0002.
- TypeScript `strict` + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`; Vite with two entry points — landing at `/`,
  game at `/game/` with a relative base so the same bundle runs inside the iOS shell.
- ESLint boundary rules enforcing the sim boundary (no platform imports, no `Math.random`/`Date.now`)
  and the platform input boundary (raw pointer events only in `src/platform/input`), with
  `tests/boundaries` asserting each rule actually fires.
- Platform seam: semantic input intents over Pointer Events, two breakpoints, entitlements stub,
  storage abstraction.
- Vitest + `verify` script; GitHub Actions CI on Ubuntu and Windows; bundle-budget check; Netlify
  deploy config.
- Design tokens (`content/design/tokens.json`) and the phone-first style guide.

##### Fixed
- Flat-config rule shadowing silently disabled every determinism check inside `src/sim`. ESLint flat
  config replaces a rule's options wholesale rather than merging them, so the later
  platform-boundary block was overriding `no-restricted-syntax`. Caught by `tests/boundaries`.
